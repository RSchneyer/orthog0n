The orthog0n is the last keyboard I'll probably design (for the forseeable future). The RGBKB Zen that I had been using for games for like 5 years bit the dust, so I decided to throw together something I had always wanted to get around to making.

As usual, I take no responsibility for anything that doesn't work, or goes wrong when you try to build or use this board. Good luck!
